    <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>
        Originally an Israeli peasant dish, Shakshuka is easy to make and delicious.
      </p>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p> Serves 4 to 6 </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
          <li>5 Anaheim chiles or 3 jalapeños, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped (I was nervous and only used 2 Anaheims; I would go for 3 or 4 next time for a more moderate but still gentle kick)</li>
          <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped
          <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed then sliced</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
          <li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, undrained</li>
          <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
          <li>6 eggs</li>
          <li>1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
          <li>Warm pitas, for serving</li>
        </ul>    
      </p>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <p>
        Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add chiles and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and paprika, and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is soft, about 2 more minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Put tomatoes and their liquid into a medium bowl and crush with your hands. Add crushed tomatoes and their liquid to skillet along with 1/2 cup water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Season sauce with salt.
        </p>
        <p>
        Crack eggs over sauce so that eggs are evenly distributed across sauce’s surface. Cover skillet and cook until yolks are just set, about 5 minutes. Using a spoon, baste the whites of the eggs with tomato mixture, being careful not to disturb the yolk. Sprinkle shakshuka with feta and parsley and serve with pitas, for dipping.
